-- this will be where chat logs will be logged i guess

-- Todo: Make some commands that will control lots of the stuff
- Set the refresh rate
- Stop for X seconds
- Whitelist/blacklist certain users from using the bot
- Enable/disable the webhook

- Also, add it so that the bot doesn't count webhooks
- Also consider if multiple people speak in the same timeframe
